## 1. Create your account

Before start using the Compayer, [sign up and create a user account](https://analytics.tst.pay.super.com/).

## 2. Set up data preferences

To process your data in real time, we need your preferences:
- Time zone

- Date format

You can always change settings later in [Profile Settings](TODO).

## 3. Import data to Compayer

To get started with analytics reports, you need to set up data source to import data to our data house.

You can use several ways to import data:

- **Set up the Compayer SDK integration**

    [Integrate our SDK to your site or platform](/docs/integration/) to send data in real-time from your backend or frontend systems.

- **Import data from a payment service**

    We support data import from *Xsolla*, *Yandex.Money* and *PaySuper* from a box.
    
    [**Please let us know**](TODO) if you need other payment systems data import and we will add it asap.

- **Import your logs or database**

    We could import any data you have from log text files in any format or directly from your database.
