# Get started

***

## 1. Create your account

Before start using the Compayer, [sign up and create a user account](TODO).

## 2. Set up data preferences

Configure your preferences to process analytics data in real-time:

- Time zone
- Default currency
- Date format

{{< figure src="/images/preferences.png">}}

You can always change settings later in [Profile Settings](TODO).

## 3. Import data to Compayer

To get started with analytics reports, you need to set up a client to import transactions data to our data house.

{{< hint info >}}
We support data from payment services: *Xsolla*, *Yandex.Money* and *PaySuper*.

[Please let us know](TODO) if you need other payment systems, and we will add it asap.
{{< /hint >}}

You can use several ways to import data:
 
- **Set up the Compayer SDK integration**

    [Integrate our SDK to your site or platform](/docs/integration/) to send data from your backend or frontend system.

- **Import your logs or database**

    We could import any data you have from log text files in any format or directly from your database.
